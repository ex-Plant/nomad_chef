# Tails the Vercel deployment for the EXACT commit being pushed and prints its
# state until READY / ERROR / CANCELED.
#
# Identifies the deployment by git commit SHA (meta.githubCommitSha), NOT by
# "newest deployment". The newest-deployment comparison is racy — a git push
# registers its deploy on Vercel within seconds, so a baseline snapshot taken
# around push time can capture the new deploy itself and then wait forever for a
# *different* one (the symptom: polls endlessly, never reports, leaks watchers).
# It can also latch onto an unrelated branch's preview. A fixed SHA has neither
# problem.

# any Vercel-linked repo unchanged.
